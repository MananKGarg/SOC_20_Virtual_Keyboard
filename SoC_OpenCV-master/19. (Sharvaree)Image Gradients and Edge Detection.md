#when we apply sobelx,sobely methods, change in intensities are along x,y directions respectively.
#combining sobelX and sobelY method gives us better result in edge detection.
#we can also include kernel size in sobelx and sobely method.
#increasing kernel size in Laplacian gradient deteriorates edge detection result.
