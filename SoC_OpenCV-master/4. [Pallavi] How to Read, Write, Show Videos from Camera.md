# How to read display and save videos using cameras:
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0);                      #to capture live stream from the default camera, VideoCapture is a class and we create an object of it. As argument we can either provide input file name. If we just want to read a video from a particular file we will give the file name like myfile.avi maybe OR we can provide the device index of the camera. By deafult it is either 0 or -1. So if we have multiple cameras and if we want to use the other camera then we can also try one for the second camera or two for the third camera and so on. 

while(True):                                    #while loop is created to capture the frame continuously and we will run this loop indefinitely
ret, frame = cap.read()                         #while this loop is true, we want to capture the frames.        

gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)  #


cv2.imshow('frame', frame)

if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
