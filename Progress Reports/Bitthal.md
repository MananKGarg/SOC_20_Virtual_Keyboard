# Virtual Keyboard


## Aim
---
We aim to build a paper keyboard which would mimic like an actual keyboard.

## Prerequisutes for the project
---
1. One needs to dual boot windows system with ubuntu
   To do so one needs to download the iso file of the operating system
   you also need to use etcher or rufus to create a bootable usb by flashing the iso file in it
2. After one is done with dual booting he needs to install python (preinstalled in ubuntu)
3. Then you can download pycharm and userfriendly ide for python


## Progress Report
---

* 23rd to 2st April 2020
  - Learned about GitHub and it's features
  - Created Git-Hub Profile and installed Visual Studio and python inside Windows.
  - I revised [python](https://www.learnpython.org/), and read some new topics( Error, Exception Handling ,Function arguments amongst others) and practised it on sites like Code-Chef and HackerRank.
  - Studied Pandas,SciPy from the resources shared by our mentor.

* 2nd to 10th April 2020
  - Completed the problems assigned to me from the 1st assignment.
  - Compared my code with the one provided by our mentor.
  
* 11th to 23th April 2020
  - Learned [OpenCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdLM6AOd2vc&list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7D1O6skqDQ-JZ1GGHKK-K) and various image processing techniques.
  
* 19th to 23rd April 2020 
  - Updated a file in the SoC_OpenCV-master repository based on [Morphological transformations](https://github.com/MananKGarg/SOC_20_Virtual_Keyboard/blob/master/SoC_OpenCV-master/17.%20(Bitthal)Morphological%20Transformations.md)
 
* 24th to 28th April 2020
  - Worked on the [Invisibility Cloak project](https://github.com/MananKGarg/SOC_20_Virtual_Keyboard/blob/master/Invisibility%20Cloak/Bitthal.md).
    
* 27th April - 10st May 2020
  - Was trying out various experiments with invisibility cloak code.
  
* Had to change the project plan a bit due to lock down, but started working on sudoku solver.

* 20th May - 25th May 2020
  - Couldn't complete it as it had involved Machine Learning and was stuck in it.
  
  
* 28th May - Present
  - Left the sudoku solver half way and took up the paper keyboard to work.
  - Started working on the Paper keyboard but taking quite a lot of time due to some errors and difficulties.
  - Uploaded my code for the [paper keyboard](https://github.com/MananKGarg/SOC_20_Virtual_Keyboard/blob/master/Paper%20Keyboard/Bitthal.md)
