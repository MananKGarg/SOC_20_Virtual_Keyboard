# Virtual-Keyboard

## Intro

The goal of this project is to build a keyboard that projects a layout onto any surface and takes input using touch-recognition.
The keyboard should be able to read user's input and give corresponding output.

## Insights into the Virtual Keyboard Project

*24-03-20*
+ Revised Python syntax and practised [few problems](https://www.codechef.com/users/sudhansh6).

*27-03-20*
+ As of today, Virtual Ubuntu is usable and [basics of GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) have been looked into.

*29-03-20*
+ I learnt the [basic syntax of markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) and made a summary of the syntax.
>[Cheatsheet](https://github.com/Sudhansh6/Virtual-Keyboard/blob/master/Markdown%20syntax%20cheatsheet.md)
+ I looked into more features that python provides from [Pythonlink1](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) 

*30-03-20*
+ My team for the project has been assigned.

*31-03-20*
+ Revised Python syntax.

*02-04-20*
+ Read about Errors and Exceptions in Python.
+ Read about Numpy and Pandas libraries.

*03-04-20*
+ Read about more functions in Numpy library.
+ Started working on Assignment 1 - Problem 2.

*04-04-20*
+ Finished Assignment 1 - Problem 2.

*06-04-20*
+ Finished Assignment 1 - Problem 3 and Problem 4(i).
+ Revised all Numpy tools and learned to use them effectively.
+ Read about PIL (pillow) library and tools to edit images.

*07-04-20*
+ Went through the solutions of Assignment 1.

*09-04-20 to 19-04-20*
+ Finished [OpenCV tutorials on Geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/opencv-python-tutorial/)
+ Watched [OpenCV tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdLM6AOd2vc&list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7D1O6skqDQ-JZ1GGHKK-K)
+ Wrote OpenCV programs testing its features. Check them [here](https://github.com/Sudhansh6/Virtual-Keyboard/tree/master/OpenCV)

*23-04-20 to 26-04-20*
+ Started writing code for Invisibilty cloak
+ worked in RGB colorspace
+ Looked into the code in HSV color space

*27-04-20 to 29-04-20*
+ Finished code for [Invisibility Cloak](https://github.com/Sudhansh6/Virtual-Keyboard/blob/master/cloak.py)
+ Finished OpenCV part of [Sudoku code](https://github.com/Sudhansh6/Virtual-Keyboard/blob/master/sudoku.py)

*30-04-20 to 14-05-20*
+ Optimized OpenCV part of [Sudoku code](https://github.com/Sudhansh6/Virtual-Keyboard/blob/master/Sudoku/sudoku_final.py)
+ Tried to implement machine learning for digit recognition.
+ Trained a [keras model](https://github.com/Sudhansh6/Virtual-Keyboard/blob/master/Sudoku/train_simple_nn.py) from custom dataset to recognise digits from sudoku board.
+ Looked into pyTesseract for recognising digits.

*20-05-20 to 22-05-20*
+ Started working on code for Virtual Keyboard.
+ Implemented the keyboard to detect multiple pointers.
+ Finished Virtual Keyboard code for one keyboard without shift and caps implementation.
 Have a look at the [code](https://github.com/Sudhansh6/Virtual-Keyboard/blob/master/Final%20Code/lite_vk.py) and [working video](https://github.com/Sudhansh6/Virtual-Keyboard/blob/master/Final%20Code/successful_1.avi).

*23-05-20 to 26-05-20*
+ Implemented shift, caps and backspace keys in the code.
+ Reviewed and optimised the code. Click [here](https://github.com/Sudhansh6/Virtual-Keyboard/blob/master/Final%20Code/virtual_keyboard.py) for optimized version.
+ Made the program work for multiple keyboard layouts.

## Conclusion

Firstly, I learnt about Markdown files and GitHub. I got to know about a lot of cool libraries in python through this project. My coding skills in python have improved. 
Libraries that were looked into in the project:
1. Numpy, pandas and SciPy
2. os
3. OpenCV
4. PyTesseract
5. Keras and TensorFlow
