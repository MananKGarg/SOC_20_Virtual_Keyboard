## AIM
The aim of the project is to develop a Projection Keyboard. This is basically an input device wherein the keyboard layout is 
projected on a flat surface and the keystrokes are recorded and passed on to the system connected to it. Hence, it enables us 
to type in a virtual setting and that makes it pretty cool.  

## Learning 
Basically, we were assigned tasks each week that included both learning and hands on experience. The tasks helped gain confidence over various concepts that I already knew and also helped me get gain new concepts and learn new theories (say the Hough Transform Theory). I always tried to go beyond the tasks and get into the things deeper so as to get insights into the concepts, code and problems essentially.

## Task 1
In the first week, we were asked to explore a wide variety of things -  
* Github - A really great platform to learn and discover things with such an amazing community. I knew the basics of Github but I never actually used it. Since, we were asked to the learn basics of Github as we would be working on it later on, I scanned through various resources to learn it.
* Markdown Files - One really important aspect of a project is to make a document that speaks out for you the purpose and procedure in brief. And that is where markdown files come into picture. We were asked to learn how to make markdown files and it's various formatting techniques.
* Python - One of the most popular languages today. A great programming language that one should definitely learn. Being a CSE person, I already knew basics of python but the resources shared with us helped me strengthen my concepts and delve deeper into the python libraries especially Numpy.  

It was essentially a great learning learning week for me.

## Task 2
The second week was actually when I started working. We were given an assignment that consisted of 4 problems to be done in a team. The problems were fairly easy to do but the concepts behind them were realy good. Except the first one that was some sort of a warmup, the problems were based on image-processing techniques (say Removal of Salt and Pepper Noise). All the problems required Numpy Library usage. The four problems were -  
* Involved working on python data structures like Dictionary and Lists.
* Based on the context of Salt and Pepper Noise, this problem was essentially the best among the four. This required me to implement a standard algorithm of segmenting an image followed by taking some sort of a mean to remove the Salt and Pepper Noise.
* This was based on a really important image processing technique of K - Means Clustering. Though we were asked to use the inbuilt functionaity of the algorithm but I read the implementation of the algorithm to get a feel of what was actually going on. 
* This was based on matplotlib library usage and one concept called the Mean Filter. We were given a set of tasks in this problem to be dealt with using the mentioned libraries/concepts.  

This week was really a great hands on experience for me that helped me explore Numpy Library to a greater extent. The assignment problems, solutions and some notes prepared by me on Numpy can be found on my github repo **[here](https://github.com/akj0811/Virtual-Keyboard/tree/master/Week%202)**.

## Task 3

OpenCV is a library of programming functions that are aimed at real-time computer vision. It supports models from Deep Learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Torch, PyTorch etc. It has wide ranging applications, a few of them are listed below - 

* Gesture Recognition
* Mobile Robotics
* Motion Understanding
* Object Identification
* Motion Tracking
* Augmented Reality
 
This week was a great learning period for me. I was asked to read the OpenCV docs and it's tutorials available online. I tried to implement codes that used those functionalities provided by the library. i had never used the library before but this helped me add another tool to my tool - box.

## Task 4
This week was pretty relaxed. All the mentees were asked to collaborate to a github repo on OpenCV. Basically, each of us had to upload two files that explained two different fucntionalities of the library. We made a wonderful repo that explained the concepts in quite detail with supporting codes in python. The link to the repo can be found **[here](https://github.com/MananKGarg/SOC_20_Virtual_Keyboard/tree/master/SoC_OpenCV-master)**.   
I uploaded 3 files -  
* [Hough Line Transform Theory](https://github.com/MananKGarg/SOC_20_Virtual_Keyboard/blob/master/SoC_OpenCV-master/28.%20%5BAnkit%5D%20Hough%20Line%20Transform%20Theory.md)
* [Hough Lines Method](https://github.com/MananKGarg/SOC_20_Virtual_Keyboard/blob/master/SoC_OpenCV-master/29.%20%5BAnkit%5D%20Hough%20Line%20Transform%20using%20HoughLines%20method%20.md)
* [Probabilistic Hough Transform](https://github.com/MananKGarg/SOC_20_Virtual_Keyboard/blob/master/SoC_OpenCV-master/30.%20%5BAnkit%5D%20Probabilistic%20Hough%20Transform%20using%20HoughLinesP.md)

## Task 5
This was again a relaxed week. We had to do a self-mini project. The project was pretty interesting. We had to perform a magic!!! Yes, that is true. But our magic was in a typical coder's style. We had to play around with the OpenCV Library and make an invisibility cloak that mimics Harry Potter. This was a cool experience. We were asked to make videos and then share those, all of them were **magical** xD.    

**[Here](https://github.com/MananKGarg/SOC_20_Virtual_Keyboard/blob/master/Invisibility%20Cloak/Ankit.md)** is a link to my documentation of the mini-project.    

## Task 6
We had to work on a Visual Sudoku Solver Project. It was a really interesting project. We had to combine ideas from Machine Learning, OpenCV and Algorithms. I was able to complete the OpenCV and Algorithms part on my own. With the Machine Learning part, I was facing some difficulty on digit recognition. It was probably due to the fact that we were training our model on Hand written digits and trying to identify Printed digits. Being from different distributions, it was a bit challenging to identify all the digits accurately everytime. My Sudoku Solver was not always working correctly.

## Task 7
We now jumped to the final part of our SoC, the Virtual Keyboard. We had to manage to enable writing over a printed paper keyboard. I was able to complete the OpenCV part and code things up properly. But I was not able to get a printout of the paper keyboard to really test it on and so I couldn't fix in the bugs or any sort of parameters present in my code. So, instead after completing my code, I looked upon the other codes on the repo, they were based on similar logic though with different implementations. Hence, I expect my code to run properly after some bug fixes.

**[Here]()** is the link to my code for the Paper Keyboard.


It was a great experience to be a part of this SoC. I got more experienced with Python Language. I got some experience working on ML by working on Sudoku Solver task. And obviously, the Paper Keyboard part was really fun though I couldn't relly test it now but as soon as the lockdown gets over and I can get a printed keyboard, I will check my implementation and update my code here. I was really an amazing journey throughout the summers working on this project.
