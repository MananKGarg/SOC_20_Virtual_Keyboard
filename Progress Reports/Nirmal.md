# Virtual Keyboard

## Overview
---
We aim to build a virtual keyboard which would mimic like an actual keyboard.

## Advantages
---
It is portable and doesn't require any physical space that a normal keyboard requires.It can be used even in dark where the obsolete keyboards cannot be used.

## Flow Chart
---
* First we will learn basics about python and relevant libraries like Numpy,matplotlib,Pandas etc and then solve as much problems as we can to master the concepts.
* The next step is to learn Open-Cv for image detection and then, implementing it in the virtual keyboard.

## Progress Report
---

* 23rd to 2st April 2020
  - I revised [python](https://www.learnpython.org/), and read some new topics( Error, Exception Handling ,Function arguments amongst others) and practised it on sites like Code-Chef and HackerRank.
  - Created Git-Hub Profile and installed Visual Studio and python inside Windows.
  - Studied Pandas,SciPy from the resources shared by our mentor.

* 2nd to 5th April 2020
  - Completed the problems assigned to me from the 1st assignment.
 
* 9h to 10th April 2020
  - Tried to solve the remaining problems and saw the solution uploaded by the mentor and saw the techniques to improve my code.
  
* 11th to 23th April 2020
  - Learned [OpenCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdLM6AOd2vc&list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7D1O6skqDQ-JZ1GGHKK-K) and various image processing techniques.
  
* 19th to 23rd April 2020 
  - Updated 2 files in the OpenCV repository (Everone had to do it which would serve as a reference whenever we would be stuck on any problem/code).
 
* 24th to 27th April 2020
    Worked in the invisibility Cloak project.
    

* 27th April - 10st May 2020
  -Had lots of pain while solving Invisibilty Project so had to revise the concept.
  
* 20th May - 25th May 2020
  - Started on the Sudoku Solver Project(20th May)
  -Couldn't complete it as it had invlolved Machine Learning and was stuck in it.
  
  
* 28th May - 31st May 2020
  - Started working on the Paper keyboard
