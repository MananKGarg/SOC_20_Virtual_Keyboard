First assignment questions give on 2nd April

Learnt about k means clustering and k++ means clustering algorithm although later I found out that we just need to use direct function in order to implement but it was all fun!!.

In that assignment work I did:


 My task requires to scan all the RGB composition values , store and then apply modifications on it to make it suitable to perform kmeans++ algorithm on it.

 After getting label and centroid lists, make a new list in which values of RGB are inserted as per algorithm.

 Finally create a new image from the new list of pixels.
