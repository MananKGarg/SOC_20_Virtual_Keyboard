Dual Booted PC and installed Ubuntu 18.04 with the help of youtube video
Youtube video link for reference- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5QyjHIYwTQ

Made a github account and learnt its basic features with the help of videos one of them is
Helpful link- https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Learnt the basics of Markdown language using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpdvNwvEeSE and https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

Get to know featurs and syntax of python through  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ and https://www.learnpython.org/

# Week2(30th March - 5th April)

Get to know about scipy library and about its features through https://scipy-lectures.org/

First assignment questions give on 2nd April

Learnt about k means clustering and k++ means clustering algorithm although later I found out that we just need to use direct function in order to implement but it was all fun!!.

In that assignment work I did:


 My task requires to scan all the RGB composition values , store and then apply modifications on it to make it suitable to perform kmeans++ algorithm on it.

 After getting label and centroid lists, make a new list in which values of RGB are inserted as per algorithm.

 Finally create a new image from the new list of pixels.
