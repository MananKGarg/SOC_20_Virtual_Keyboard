# Virtual-Keyboard

## Aim:
The project is about making a virtual keyboard that can be projected on any flat surface
like a table and then can be used to type in real-time.

## Project Progress:

##### 2-April-2020
* Project team is give first [problem statement](https://github.com/MananKGarg/SOC_20_Virtual_Keyboard/blob/master/Assignment%201/Assignment%201%20Problems/Assignment%201%20Problems.pdf).
* Learnt module 7,9 and numpy.
##### 3-April-2020

##### 4-April-2020
* Solved problem 1 from assignment
##### 5-April-2020
* Solved problem 2 from assignment
##### 6-April-2020
* Solved problem 3 from assignment
##### 7-April-2020
* Studied solution code and learnt Pandas
##### 8-April-2020
* Learnt about Matplotlib
##### 9-April-2020
* Set up Laptop for OpenCV
* (anaconda prompt vs command prompt)
##### 10-April-2020
* Did basic OpenCV
##### 11-April-2020
* OpenCV tutorial 1-5
##### 12-April-2020
* OpenCV tutorial 6-10
##### 13-April-2020
* OpenCV tutorial 11-15
##### 14-April-2020
* OpenCV tutorial 16-20
##### 15-April-2020
* OpenCV tutorial 20-25
##### 16-April-2020
* OpenCV tutorial 25-30
##### 24-April-2020
* Basic Invisibility cloak
#####  25-April-2020 to 30-April-2020
* Fine tuned code and added feature to turn invisible on command.
* The final code is [Here](https://github.com/MananKGarg/SOC_20_Virtual_Keyboard/blob/master/Invisibility%20Cloak/Jeff.md).
##### 30-April-2020 to 4-May-2020
* Documentaion of OpenCV notes and wraping up stuff till now.
##### 5-May-2020 to 7-May-2020
* Wrote code to extract sudoku from an image
* Wrote code to solve a sudoku given as a numpy array.
##### 7-May-2020 to 14-May-2020
* Learnt about keras and digit recognition.
* Struggled with digit recognition due to intrinsic noise from the grid and hence resorted to training my model of my owm sudoku.
* Completed code to recognise digits
##### 14-May-2020 to 22-May-2020
* Merged codes to make a working sudoku solver!
* The final code is [Here](https://github.com/MananKGarg/SOC_20_Virtual_Keyboard/blob/master/Sudoku/Jeff.md).
##### 22-May-2020 to 27-May-2020
* Wrote code to find location of finger.
* Implemented a timed based setup to register a key as pressed when the time crossed a certian threshold.
* Added a shift and a caps feature to the keyboard.
* Voila! A functioning [paper keyboard](https://github.com/MananKGarg/SOC_20_Virtual_Keyboard/blob/master/Paper%20Keyboard/Jeff.md).

## Summary:
This project has been a great learning experience over the last two months. Prior to this project I had no knowledge on Python programming or the various libraries it had to offer, but through the course of this project I was able to learn a lot about Python and about some of it's important libraries, Image processing and even a little Machine learning! I thank WnCC for this initiative and my mentor, Manan for all the guidance and support without which this would not have been possible.
