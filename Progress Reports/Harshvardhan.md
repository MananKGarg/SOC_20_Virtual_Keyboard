Week 1-4
I went through all of the resources sent by mentor. I didn't have anything to practice then as my phone display had been damaged, and I lost contact from the group.

Week 5-7
I tried to gain access to the group, but couldn't really as my face still is continuing to face the same problem. I learned some amount of Python on my own-- it's FUN!

Week 8-9
Soon after gaining access to the Whatsapp group( I literally had to DESTROY my old whatsapp account), I tried coping up with my fellowmates, but I took up a lot of time. I did get the laptop repaired as well(the one having Windows 10;my windows 7 couldn't allow Python 3.5+ versions). I tried quiter hard to get to the actual motive of this project, just focusing on Virtual Keyboard. Just recently, I did take help from my colleagues, and they helped happily through all my doubts. I finally have done it, but my GitHub couldn't upload anything on Manan's GitHub, coz I didn't accept the invitation in time(I had no access anyways). I am quite tensed whether or not my project, though completed on-time, would be accepted. But truly, SoC is quite fun!!
