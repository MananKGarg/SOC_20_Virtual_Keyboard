# Instructions

* This is a graded team assignment and a leaderboard of Teams will be prepared on the basis of scores obtained.
* You are free to discuss within or outside your teams.
* There are 4 python problems in this assignment. Each member of the team has to pick one for themselves and is responsible for solving that particular problem. Team members need to mutually decide which problem are they gonna solve. 
* However, it is not necessary to work just on your problem if you are done with it. Team members are infact encouraged to help each other.
* You should work in your team's file in your team's branch only.
* For submission, every team member has to create a file named as **YourName_Problem_Number.py** in your team's folder.
* In the markdown file, every team member has to fill their portion of problem description and Solution.
* You can mutually decide about the meme part :)
* The main purpose of this assignment is to get you acquainted with the nitty-gritties of basic python and basic markdown. Both will be necessary for us to move further.
